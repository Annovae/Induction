# Induction
**A Polyglot Database Client for Mac OS X**

*Induction is still in its early alpha stage of development, and has a long way to go before it's production-ready. A development roadmap will be formalized soon, and made available in the GitHub project wiki. This will define the feature set for a 1.0 release, and serve to carve up the work across contributors.*

### Explore, Query, Visualize

Focus on the data, not the database. Induction is a new kind of tool designed for understanding and communicating relationships in data. Explore rows and columns, query to get exactly what you want, and visualize that data in powerful ways.

### SQL? NoSQL? It Don't Matter

Data is just data, after all. Induction supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Redis, and MongoDB  out-of-the-box, and has an extensible architecture that makes it easy to write adapters for anything else you can think of.

### Free As In "Free to Kick Ass"

The full source code for Induction [is available on GitHub](https://github.com/Induction/Induction). I'm excited to build something insanely great, and I invite you to join me on this codeventure. Bug reports, feature requests, patches, well-wishes, and rap demo tapes are always welcome.

### What's In A Name?

</dl>

Data is like electricity: It appears in endless variety, employing adapters and transformers to become more useful. But no matter what, data is power. From data, we derive knowledge and understanding through a process of induction.

### So Who's Behind All Of This?

Induction was created by [Mattt Thompson](http://twitter.com/mattt/), with the help of his friends and colleagues at [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/), particularly those on the [Heroku Postgres](https://postgres.heroku.com/) team.

## Requirements

Induction requires Xcode 4.2 or above, and targets Mac OS 10.7. 

Some adapters, such as for MySQL and MongoDB, require libraries not included in OS X by default. These can be installed separately using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) or another package manager, or by compiling from source.

## Downloads

Pre-compiled binaries of Induction are available in the [downloads](https://github.com/Induction/Induction/downloads) section of the repository. A more sustainable distribution strategy is actively being worked towards.
